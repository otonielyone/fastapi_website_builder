Approximately 5200 total finished square feet. This is an amazing opportunity to enjoy a brand-new home that has never been lived in! This stunning 6-bedroom, 5-bath home with a 3-car garage is completely finished on three levels and is situated on a private .43-acre lot, surrounded by 2 acres of beautiful trees and open space. Located in one of the most desirable areas in Falls Church, this colonial/open floor concept brick home overlooks the Malbrook subdivision leading into Lake Barcroft. The main level features a welcoming foyer that leads into an expansive living room/family room with a cozy fireplace. The spacious dining room is conveniently located on the other side of the foyer. The open and inviting gourmet kitchen provides ample room to entertain, cook, relax, and enjoy time with family, friends, and guests. This kitchen is complete with a center counter range, upgraded countertops, stainless steel upgraded appliances, and much more! The garage also has a convenient entrance directly to the kitchen for easy unloading of groceries, and other household necessities.

Crafted with the utmost attention to detail, and the finest materials, is conveniently situated near Washington, D.C. and excellent schools. Upon arrival, one immediately notices the exceptional landscaping, distinct from the typical builder's fare. The yard and trees were artfully designed by Charles Owen and Fine Landscaping, setting the property apart. The house itself is constructed from authentic building stone. The exterior features Hardie Plank cement board in a board and batten style, complemented by sleek black Andersen 400 series windows. A distinctive over-sized, side-load  silo garage accommodates two cars together, while a separate space allows for an additional car. Enhanced security measures, including video monitoring on all sides of the house, provide peace of mind. Upon entering the spacious front porch, you'll notice the slate flooring, providing a comfortable sitting area. Passing through the solid wood door with beveled glass, you'll step into an inviting open floor plan featuring 10-foot ceilings and white oak hardwood floors. To the left is the formal dining room adorned with cove molding, designer lighting fixtures, chair rail, and panel molding. On the right is the formal living room, echoing the elegance with cove molding, chair rail, and panel moldings. Further in, a unique feature awaits - the butler&#x2019;s pantry, serving as a bar and open to the foyer. Custom cabinetry distressed with mirror doors and handcrafted hardware from Carpe Diem add to the charm, along with a wine chiller and ice maker. Moving towards the rear of the home, a spacious family room unfolds, seamlessly connected to the kitchen. The family room boasts a beautiful granite wall with a gas linear fireplace and a glass wall opening to the rear covered veranda. A rear morning room with vaulted ceilings and stained white oak beams complements the scene. The kitchen is a showstopper, featuring a large black center island, distressed cabinetry, quartz countertops, and high-end appliances. Continuing through the home, a library on the main floor can double as a bedroom with an attached full bath and closet. Ascending to the upper level reveals three generously sized secondary bedrooms, each with unique designer tiles, walk-in closets, recessed lights, and provisions for ceiling fans. The Owner's suite offers its own foyer, a morning kitchen, multiple closets, and a bedroom with elegant features, including a Tray ceiling, recessed lights, cove molding, and pre-wiring for televisions. The Owner's suite exudes luxury with his and her vanities, custom cabinetry, a freestanding tub, water closet, and an exquisite shower with custom tiling. The owner's closets provides ample space for two, along with storage for shoes, purses, and sweaters. A back door leads to an upstairs bonus room, suitable for an exercise room, nursery, or an office. Accessible through the laundry, it facilitates convenient use for the owner&#x2019;s suite. The laundry room accommodates two washers and dryers with blue cabinetry, and a window adds to the pleasant laundry experience. Descending to the lower level, a vast open space awaits, housing an exercise room, media room, and a rec room with built-in bookshelves and cabinetry, all crafted from black walnut. A stone fireplace and matching bar enhance the space, complete with designer features, an ice machine, wine chiller, and refrigerator.
