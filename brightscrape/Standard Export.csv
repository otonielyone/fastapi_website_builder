Crafted with the utmost attention to detail, and the finest materials, is conveniently situated near Washington, D.C. and excellent schools. Upon arrival, one immediately notices the exceptional landscaping, distinct from the typical builder's fare. The yard and trees were artfully designed by Charles Owen and Fine Landscaping, setting the property apart. The house itself is constructed from authentic building stone. The exterior features Hardie Plank cement board in a board and batten style, complemented by sleek black Andersen 400 series windows. A distinctive over-sized, side-load  silo garage accommodates two cars together, while a separate space allows for an additional car. Enhanced security measures, including video monitoring on all sides of the house, provide peace of mind. Upon entering the spacious front porch, you'll notice the slate flooring, providing a comfortable sitting area. Passing through the solid wood door with beveled glass, you'll step into an inviting open floor plan featuring 10-foot ceilings and white oak hardwood floors. To the left is the formal dining room adorned with cove molding, designer lighting fixtures, chair rail, and panel molding. On the right is the formal living room, echoing the elegance with cove molding, chair rail, and panel moldings. Further in, a unique feature awaits - the butler&#x2019;s pantry, serving as a bar and open to the foyer. Custom cabinetry distressed with mirror doors and handcrafted hardware from Carpe Diem add to the charm, along with a wine chiller and ice maker. Moving towards the rear of the home, a spacious family room unfolds, seamlessly connected to the kitchen. The family room boasts a beautiful granite wall with a gas linear fireplace and a glass wall opening to the rear covered veranda. A rear morning room with vaulted ceilings and stained white oak beams complements the scene. The kitchen is a showstopper, featuring a large black center island, distressed cabinetry, quartz countertops, and high-end appliances.

Crafted with the utmost attention to detail, and the finest materials, is conveniently situated near Washington, D.C. and excellent schools. Upon arrival, one immediately notices the exceptional landscaping, distinct from the typical builder's fare. The yard and trees were artfully designed by Charles Owen and Fine Landscaping, setting the property apart. The house itself is constructed from authentic building stone. The exterior features Hardie Plank cement board in a board and batten style, complemented by sleek black Andersen 400 series windows. A distinctive over-sized, side-load  silo garage accommodates two cars together, while a separate space allows for an additional car. Enhanced security measures, including video monitoring on all sides of the house, provide peace of mind. Upon entering the spacious front porch, you'll notice the slate flooring, providing a comfortable sitting area. Passing through the solid wood door with beveled glass, you'll step into an inviting open floor plan featuring 10-foot ceilings and white oak hardwood floors. To the left is the formal dining room adorned with cove molding, designer lighting fixtures, chair rail, and panel molding. On the right is the formal living room, echoing the elegance with cove molding, chair rail, and panel moldings. Further in, a unique feature awaits - the butler&#x2019;s pantry, serving as a bar and open to the foyer. Custom cabinetry distressed with mirror doors and handcrafted hardware from Carpe Diem add to the charm, along with a wine chiller and ice maker. Moving towards the rear of the home, a spacious family room unfolds, seamlessly connected to the kitchen. The family room boasts a beautiful granite wall with a gas linear fireplace and a glass wall opening to the rear covered veranda.
